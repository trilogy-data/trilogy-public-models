Tests of chitin (found in some simple genera, and Textularia in particular) are believed to be the most primitive type. Most foraminifera are marine, the majority of which live on or within the seafloor sediment (i.e., are benthic, with different sized species playing a role within the macrobenthos, meiobenthos, and microbenthos), while a smaller number float in the water column at various depths (i.e., are planktonic), which belong to the suborder Globigerinina."

Planoglabratella,,"A protist () is any eukaryotic organism (one with cells containing a nucleus) that is not an animal, plant, or fungus. The protists do not form a natural group, or clade, since they exclude certain eukaryotes with whom they share a common ancestor; but, like algae or invertebrates, the grouping is used for convenience. In some systems of biological classification, such as the popular five-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, the protists make up a kingdom called Protista, composed of ""organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues""."

This genus is sometimes called Orthoceratites and misspelled as Orthocera, Orthocerus, or Orthoceros.

Rubratella,,"A protist () is any eukaryotic organism (one with cells containing a nucleus) that is not an animal, plant, or fungus. The protists do not form a natural group, or clade, since they exclude certain eukaryotes with whom they share a common ancestor; but, like algae or invertebrates, the grouping is used for convenience. In some systems of biological classification, such as the popular five-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, the protists make up a kingdom called Protista, composed of ""organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues""."

She is mainly remembered for a legend dating back to at least the 13th century, in which she rode naked – covered only by her long hair – through the streets of Coventry to gain a remission of the oppressive taxation that her husband, Leofric, imposed on his tenants. The name ""Peeping Tom"" for a voyeur originates from later versions of this legend, in which a man named Thomas watched her ride and was struck blind or dead."

the shell is subcylindrical and pupoid in shape
the whorls wind obliquely on the last two-thirds of the shell
sculpture: the earlier whorls are smooth, the later ones bear fine incised, spiral grooves
the shape of the aperture is pyriform to circular
the columella is excavate
the outer lip is grooved within and bevelled to a sharp edge
Differences between the species are defined by the shell gradually widening towards the body whorl, or the shell not widening but is cylindrical.

Tests of chitin (found in some simple genera, and Textularia in particular) are believed to be the most primitive type. Most foraminifera are marine, the majority of which live on or within the seafloor sediment (i.e., are benthic, with different sized species playing a role within the macrobenthos, meiobenthos, and microbenthos), while a smaller number float in the water column at various depths (i.e., are planktonic), which belong to the suborder Globigerinina."

In some systems of biological classification, such as the popular five-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, the protists make up a kingdom called Protista, composed of ""organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues""."

Fossils of this genus have been found in many places in the Indo-Pacific, but also going as far back as 61.7 Ma in paleocene strata of Alabama, USA.


== Original description ==
Although having the small smooth embryo of a single whorl, polished surface and obsolete lines of growth, characterizing Pleurotoma (now Turris), this genus may be recognized at once by the relatively shorter and stouter form as a rule, less elongate and straighter beak, which is strongly tapering in certain large forms like line unedo, finer, more acutely elevated and less close-set spiral carinae, with a usually distinct and even, finely lineolate concavity from the peripheral carina to the suture or subsutural collar, the latter being generally present and by the deep anal sinus formed centrally on, and not behind, the peripheral carina, the latter being more strongly elevated and 
usually subduplex.

The synonymy of Parthenina (Bucquoy, Dautzenberg & Dolfus, 1883) with Besla (Doll & Bartsch, 1904) proposed by Micali et al., (2012) is debatable. The type species of Besla has a protoconch axis at 90° with that of teleoconch (Type A protoconch), whereas that of Parthenina is tilted at nearly 180° (Type C); therefore, these divergent characteristics suggest that Besla and Parthenina are unrelated and that their teleoconch sculpture may be convergent."

Schizammina,,"A protist () is any eukaryotic organism (one with cells containing a nucleus) that is not an animal, plant, or fungus. The protists do not form a natural group, or clade, since they exclude certain eukaryotes with whom they share a common ancestor; but, like algae or invertebrates, the grouping is used for convenience. In some systems of biological classification, such as the popular five-kingdom scheme proposed by Robert Whittaker in 1969, the protists make up a kingdom called Protista, composed of ""organisms which are unicellular or unicellular-colonial and which form no tissues""."

Sipho,,"A siphon (from Ancient Greek  σίφων (síphōn) 'pipe, tube'; also spelled syphon) is any of a wide variety of devices that involve the flow of liquids through tubes. In a narrower sense, the word refers particularly to a tube in an inverted ""U"" shape, which causes a liquid to flow upward, above the surface of a reservoir, with no pump, but powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity, then discharging at a level lower than the surface of the reservoir from which it came.
There are two leading theories about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity."

== Description ==
These clams have two short siphons, each with a horny sheath. The shell is shaped like a rounded-cornered equilateral triangle and there is a slight gape at the posterior."

Pearl oysters are not true oysters, and belong to the order Pteriida.
Like scallops, true oysters have a central adductor muscle, which means the shell has a characteristic central scar marking its point of attachment."

== Description ==
(Original description by Verrill)  As at present understood, this genus is intended to include those species which have a rather broad and very distinct subsutural band, crossed by excurved lines of growth corresponding to the form of the posterior sinus of the lip, which is situated a little below the suture and is always pretty well-developed, but is sometimes broad and shallow, and at other times narrower and very deep. The outer lip is always thin and sharp, without any appearance of a varix, nor is there any deposit of callus on the body whorl, in front of the aperture."
