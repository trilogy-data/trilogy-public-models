Trilogy can be used standalone, but the Studio is similar to mashup of Bigquery Studio and Looker Studio - or Redash - and is designed to make exploring, modeling, and presenting data easy. Trilogy centralizes semantic and modeling in the language layer, making it perfect for data consumption work with fast feedback and iteration loops, composability, and reuse.  \n\nThis dashboard is based on a demo model (the common TPC-H dataset) and runs using DuckDB WASM in your browser. Dashboards should work well on desktop or mobile, though drilldown is not supported on mobile. If you want to play around with more interesting data, the 'share & explore' option on the sidebar has a list of public datasets you can import from BigQuery, DuckDB, and Snowflake. (the [satellite dashboard](https://trilogydata.dev/trilogy-studio-core/#screen=dashboard-import&import=https%3A%2F%2Ftrilogy-data.github.io%2Ftrilogy-public-models%2Fstudio%2Fgcat_space.json&dashboard=satellite_dashboard&modelName=gcat_space&connection=duckdb) is a fun different view). You can also directly query data through the 'editors' on the top left of the left-hand nav. \n\nNote: This dashboard is in view mode by default; click the mode dropdown in the top right to change to edit or fullscreen. We'd recommend staying in view mode to scan the dashboard, then trying to edit. Feel free to destroy the dashboard - it's local to you. \n\nBut first, some charts: we're looking at {order_id_count} orders from customers in {order_customer_nation_id_count} countries, ordering parts from suppliers in {part_supplier_nation_id_count} nations. Each of these views is a simple SQL query + some lightweight chart configuration - and they can all freely cross-filter and interact. We'll explains some features as you scroll down. \n\nWe'll start with some basic headline metrics and a bar chart. ",

Trilogy handles appropriately passing these traits through transformations and clients can optionally consume these, as the Studio does. You can further customize the visuals - the perfect visual can't always be inferred - but if you can fix the display by fixing the model, that's the best for reuse. \n\n```trilogy\nimport std.geography; # access the country type\nproperty id.name string::country; # capitalized; eg UNITED STATES or FRANCE or CANADA\n```\n\n",
